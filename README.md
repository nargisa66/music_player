# MUSIC PLAYER
You could make your music player better by letting users manage their playlists, such as adding and removing songs. Adding a volume control slider would let users adjust how loud the music is. A progress bar would show how far along the song is and let users skip to different parts of the song. Displaying more information about the song, like the album cover and release year, would make the player more informative.
Adding shuffle and repeat options would make listening more fun. Custom buttons for play, pause, next, and previous would make the player look unique. Improving the design with nice animations and styles would make it look better.

Handling errors when a song can't be played would make the player more reliable. Letting users control the player with keyboard shortcuts would make it easier to use. Making sure the player works well on all devices, including phones and tablets, would make it accessible to everyone.
